# lines_triangles_and_cross_products 

Interactively explore the relationships
between three points in a plane and the cross product.

The cross product is zero if the three points are colinear.

The cross product is maximal if one of the angles is 90 degrees.

A quaternion product though has 4 places. What does that mean?
