# Quaternion Cross Product

Div, grad, curl, dot product, and cross product were all terms coined by one individual studying one thing: William 
Rowan Hamilton in his study of quaternions. What all students study today is the convenient divorce granted by 
Josiah Gibbs. Vector algebra is one of the most useful toolkits in one's mathematical collection. Vector algebra is
such a dominant force in the mind's eye it may not be possible to image different perspectives on the subject. Yet that
is my goal - not to say vector algebra is wrong in any way since there always necessarily is an equivalence relation
between vector algebra and quaternions. Rather, one may gain new insights based on the the relationships between terms
that are simply not there due to the divorce.

What is a quaternion cross product? When one multiplies two quaternion together, it is the odd part of the product:

st.latex(A B = (A B + B A)/2 + (A B - B A)/2 = Even(A B) + Odd(A B) )

This is not the standard definition of a Gibbs cross product because there is no notion of the Even() product which
happens to be a combination of the difference of a scalar times a scalar and  vector dot product summed with scalars 
times vectors (translation: an abomination to those schooled in vector algebra).

If one just focuses on the quaternion cross product, the scalar term
